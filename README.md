# Web Locks API

[![CI](https://github.com/w3c/web-locks/actions/workflows/auto-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/w3c/web-locks/actions/workflows/auto-publish.yml)

A web platform API that allows script to asynchronously acquire a lock over a resource, hold it while work is performed, then release it. While held, no other script in the origin can aquire a lock over the same resource. This allows contexts (windows, workers) within a web application to coordinate the usage of resources.
